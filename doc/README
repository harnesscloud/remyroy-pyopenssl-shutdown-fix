Only the .tex format documentation is original,
because the others are derived from it, so don't
edit them directly.  To build the other formats
use a command of ...

  make all


To build the documentation you will need to have
latex2html and lynx installed.  On fedora both can
be obtained with...

  sudo yum install latex2html lynx
